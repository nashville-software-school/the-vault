# Polymer Components

Using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), have each team member construct a web component that will be composed into a single page application that uses local storage.

Here's some example ideas.

1. A clock, a calendar, and a contact list for keeping track of time and appointments with people.
1. A material and project tracker for a hobbyist. Materials get included in projects, and when a project is complete, the count of each material must be updated.
1. A wilderness preparedness application. Current weather conditions, gear packing list, mapping component to see terrain, and hazard alerts.
1. A personal dashboard with events, tasks, and news articles.
