# Alpha and Omega

1. Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled *Create*.
1. When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM. You decide the height/width of the card.
1. Above the text on each card, there must be two input controls of type `color`.
1. Above the text on each card, there must be a button element labeled *Delete*.
1. When the user selects a color from the first input, then the background color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
1. When the user selects a color from the second input, then the font color of that card, and no other cards, should change to the color chosen.
1. When the user clicks the *Delete* button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.
